This project is a fully responsive, theme-switchable, and component-based React frontend built to replicate a professionally designed portfolio shared via Figma. The goal was to recreate the UI layout and styling with high fidelity, while maintaining accessibility, modularity, and responsive behavior.

🎯 Objective
Replicate a given high-fidelity Figma design into a working frontend interface using modern technologies such as React.js, HTML, CSS, and minimal Bootstrap. The implementation emphasizes clean architecture, reusable components, and visual accuracy across light/dark themes and screen sizes.

✨ Key Features
- 🔁 Pixel-perfect layout inspired by a Figma design prototype
- 🌙 Theme toggle with persistent localStorage state
- ⌨️ Keyboard & screen-reader accessibility through semantic HTML
- 🔗 Section-scrolling with navigation highlights and smooth transitions
- 📱 Fully responsive grid/flexbox layout with mobile-first styling
- 🎨 Custom theming using CSS variables and dark/light adaptive assets
- 📧 Fixed-position contact and social icons with responsive orientation
- ♻️ Modular React component structure for scalability and clarity
